## 1. Text Classification with Pre-trained Models
**Folder**: `Text-Classification`

This project demonstrates text classification using state-of-the-art pre-trained language models such as BERT and RoBERTa. The code covers loading the model, fine-tuning it on a specific dataset, and evaluating its performance.

### Features:
- Using nltk for text processing and sentiment analysis

## 2. Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**Folder**: `chatbot_rag`

This project implements a chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation, where a retrieval system fetches relevant documents, and a generative model (such as BART) generates responses based on the retrieved content.

### Features:
- Retrieval model setup using FAISS or Elasticsearch
- Generative response construction with transformer models
- Interactive user interface for testing the chatbot

## 3. Image Captioning with Vision-Language Models
**Folder**: `image_captioning`

In this project, an image captioning system is built using vision-language models like CLIP or a combination of CNNs and transformers.

### Features:
- Image feature extraction with pre-trained CNNs
- Caption generation using transformer models
- Evaluation with BLEU and CIDEr scores

## 4. Summarization System with T5 or BART
**Folder**: `summarization`

This project showcases text summarization using models like T5 or BART. The system can summarize articles, reports, or other long texts efficiently.

### Features:
- Implementation of abstractive summarization
- Model fine-tuning on a summarization dataset
- Quality evaluation using ROUGE metrics

## 5. Question Answering System Using Dense Retrieval + BERT
**Folder**: `question_answering`

This system integrates a dense retrieval component with a BERT-based reader to answer questions from a knowledge base or document set.

### Features:
- Dense retrieval setup using tools like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval)
- BERT or similar transformer model for passage reading
- End-to-end pipeline for question answering

## 6. Text Generation with GPT-3 or GPT-4 and Fine-Tuning
**Folder**: `text_generation`

Explore text generation with OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 models, including fine-tuning them for specific applications or creative outputs.

### Features:
- Interaction with the OpenAI API for text generation
- Fine-tuning on custom datasets
- Analysis of generated text for coherence and creativity

## 7. Text-to-Speech System Using Quantized Models
**Folder**: `text_to_speech`

A project that implements a text-to-speech (TTS) system using quantized models for optimized performance on smaller devices.

### Features:
- Text processing and speech synthesis
- Model quantization for resource-efficient deployment
- Audio output generation

## 8. Multi-lingual Sentiment Analysis Using Cross-lingual Models
**Folder**: `sentiment_analysis`

This project employs cross-lingual models such as XLM-RoBERTa to perform sentiment analysis on texts in multiple languages.

### Features:
- Pre-trained cross-lingual model loading
- Sentiment classification in different languages
- Performance comparison across languages

## 9. Few-Shot Learning for Image Classification
**Folder**: `few_shot_learning`

A demonstration of few-shot learning techniques for image classification using models like Siamese Networks or Meta-Learning algorithms.

### Features:
